The aim of this project was to make our work look like the first two parts<br>
of the Tesla website. We wanted it to feel just like you were browsing<br>
a real website.

### About The Project

The assignment was supposed to simulate the first two sections of the original Tesla website,<br>
the assignment was given as part of a Front-End BootCamp, as per writing those words, we<br>
have practiced HTML for almost 2 weeks and this week we have started CSS, the purpose<br>
was to make us understand basic website structure, and practice new skills we learned<br>
this week.
